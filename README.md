## Introduction to AMBA  
The **Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA)** is widely used in **System-on-Chip (SoC) designs**. Developed by **ARM**, AMBA provides modular system design, technology independence, and reusability while minimizing silicon infrastructure.  

The key AMBA versions include:  
- **AMBA 2 (1999)** â€“ Introduced **AHB** (Advanced High-performance Bus).  
- **AMBA 3 (2003)** â€“ Added **AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)** for higher performance.  
- **AMBA 4 (2010-2011)** â€“ Improved **system-wide coherency** via **AXI Coherency Extensions (ACE)**.  
- **AMBA 5 (2013)** â€“ Introduced **Coherent Hub Interface (CHI)** for high-speed interconnects.

## AMBA Bus Architecture  
AMBA provides a standardized framework for SoC interconnects, enabling **multi-master, high-bandwidth communication**.

### Types of AMBA Buses  
1. **ASB** â€“ Advanced System Bus  
2. **APB** â€“ Advanced Peripheral Bus  
3. **AHB** â€“ Advanced High-performance Bus  
4. **AXI** â€“ Advanced eXtensible Interface  
5. **ATB** â€“ Advanced Trace Bus  

### AHB vs. APB  
- **AHB** (Advanced High-performance Bus) is a **high-speed, pipelined** bus used for memory controllers.  
- **APB** (Advanced Peripheral Bus) is a **low-power, simple interface** designed for peripheral registers.  
- **Key differences:**  
  - **AHB** supports bursts, pipelining, and multiple masters.  
  - **APB** is optimized for **low power and minimal complexity**.

## Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)  
APB is an **extension of AHB/AXI**, used to connect peripherals with minimal **power and bandwidth requirements**. It provides a **memory-mapped register interface** for peripheral communication.

### APB Block Diagram

### APB Signal Specification  
- **PCLK** â€“ Clock signal for synchronization.  
- **PRESET** â€“ Active-low reset signal.  
- **PADDR** â€“ Address bus for peripheral selection.  
- **PENABLE** â€“ Indicates the access phase.  
- **PWRITE** â€“ Determines if the operation is read/write.  
- **PWDATA** â€“ Data bus for write operations.  
- **PRDATA** â€“ Data bus for read operations.  
- **PREADY** â€“ Indicates if the slave is ready.

## APB Design and Operating States  
APB operates in three states:  

1. **IDLE** â€“ Default state when no transfer is occurring.  
2. **SETUP** â€“ Address and control signals are asserted.  
3. **ACCESS** â€“ Data transfer occurs; slave responds with `PREADY`.  

### Write Operation  
![Write Operation](Images/img4.jpg)  
- At **T1**, the master sends address (`PADDR`), data (`PWDATA`), and control signals (`PWRITE`, `PSEL`).  
- At **T2**, the slave asserts `PREADY` and completes the transfer.  
- At **T3**, signals reset, and the bus returns to IDLE.  

### Read Operation  
![Read Operation](Images/img5.jpg)  
- At **T1**, the master initiates the read request.  
- At **T2**, the slave provides data (`PRDATA`) and asserts `PREADY`.  
- At **T3**, the transaction completes, and control signals are deasserted.
